# 🔔 Streamlit Alert Dashboard

This is a lightweight, interactive dashboard for visualizing alert data (like from Squadcast or similar systems) using a CSV export.

Built with **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **Pandas**, this tool helps you and your team get quick insights into:
- ⏱️ Average time-to-resolve (TTR)
- 📊 Alert volume per service
- 📅 Trends in alert creation
- 🕒 Busiest hours of the day
- 🔁 Most frequently triggered alerts (with live links)

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload your CSV alert export  
✅ Filter by service  
✅ View alert trends over time  
✅ See most frequent alert titles and click through to investigate  
✅ Easy to run locally, or host privately

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alert-dashboard.git
cd alert-dashboard
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_alert_dashboard.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## 🗂️ CSV Format

The CSV should include these columns (headers may vary slightly):

* `id` – Unique alert/incident ID
* `title` – Alert message/title
* `created_at`, `acknowledged_at`, `resolved_at` – Timestamps (`dd/mm/yy HH:MM` format expected)
* `ttr (ms)` – Time to resolve in milliseconds
* `service` – The affected service or client

A sample alert URL is generated using the `id` like:

```
https://app.squadcast.com/incident/<id>
```
